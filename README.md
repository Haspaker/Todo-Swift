## How to use

Download the binary and launch it (you only need to launch it once). A new Todo Widget should then appear in your Notification Center. Choose `Edit` at the bottom to add it to the Today area.

If the binary for some reason does not work, try building it from source via XCode. All the relevant code is in the `Todo Widget` folder.
